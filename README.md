# The Medieval Manuscripts Ontology: MeMO

The Medieval Manuscripts Ontology (MeMO, https://w3id.org/irnerio/ontology/memo) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that aims to provide a framework for the formal description of the collection of medieval codices and manuscripts, managed by Progetto IRNERIO, according to certain requirements and with the possibility to extend it for representing similar resources that exist in other collections. It has been developed by using the _Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development_ (Peroni, S. (2016). SAMOD: an agile methodology for the development of ontologies. figshare. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3189769).
